# Mic-2 processor
In fact, this project is not only about a processor, but contain a whole Von Neumann architecture, with in addition a RAM an input unit and an output unit. The project is a simplistic educative realisation of a whole 8 bit architecture in [Logsim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), the processor called Mic-2 was inspired from [Mic-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIC-1) processor whom was described in the popular book [Structured Computer Organization](https://www.amazon.com/Structured-Computer-Organization-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132916525) by A. Tanenbaum, however the detailed implementation was guided by D.C. Schuurman paper [Step-by-step design and simulation of a simple CPU architecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2445196.2445296).
This project was first prescribed like a mini project for college students, it was required for students to implement two basic programs, Factorial program and Fibonacci program.

# How to use it
It is very simple to use Mic-2 architecture, all you have to do, is to open the file _Mic-2 Architeture.circ_ with [Logsim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and you have the entire architecture to play with.

You probably want to execute a program on it, to do so go inside the **Memory** bloc, then the **RAM** bloc and load the image of one of the programs found in the directory _/Programs_, you need to load one of the memory image file with the extension **.RAM**.

You can also write your own program in machine language, although you have to use hexadecimal values to represent instructions opcode of 8 bit each (2 hexadecimal digits), to do so you have to use the list of instructions opcode found in the file _/Micro-code/Micro _Prgram ROM.pdf_. You have 16 different instructions, the instructions opcode are black shaded.
# Files and directories description
1. Mic-2 Architeture.circ : the main circuit, contains all the components, sufficient to run all the architecture.
2. Mic-2.png : the image above.
3. README.md : this text.
4. Micro-code : directory that contains 3 files related to the micro-program and the op-codes of all instructions.
   1. MicroProgram.ROM : the ROM to be used inside the Command and Control Unit (UCC), exactly within MP-ROM, it contains the micro-instructions.
   2. Micro Prgram ROM.pdf : this table contains all the micro-instructions and their interpretation, the op-codes for instructions are black shaded.
   3. Micro Prgram ROM.odt : it's the source of the pdf version above, it is only meant to allow its modification by libre office when adding more instructions.
5. Programs : directory that contains 3 elementary programs to use within Mic-2; factorial, fibonacci and 2 integers multiplication.
   1. Factorial.RAM : the binary file of the factorial program to put in the RAM.
   2. Factorial.txt : the assembler code of the factorial program, its allow understanding the generation of the binary version of the program.
   3. Fibonacci.RAM : the binary file of the fibonacci program to put in the RAM.
   4. Fibonacci.txt : the assembler code of the factorial program, its allow understanding the generation of the binary version of the program.
   5. Multiplication.RAM : the binary file of the multiplication program to put in the RAM.
   6. Multiplication.txt : the assembler code of the multiplication program, its allow understanding the generation of the binary version of the program.
6. Project statement : directory containing text files for the description in french language of the processor and the architecture working.
   1. mini-projet.pdf : contains the project statement for students on how to implement Mic-2 (in french language).
   2. mini-projet.odt : same as the PDF version above, to be open with libre office.
7. ROMs : directory containing the display unit ROMs file.
   1. Ones digits.ROM : ROM file for the ones seven segment digit display.
   2. Tens digits.ROM : ROM file for the tens seven segment digit display.
   3. Hundreds digits.ROM : ROM file for the hundreds seven segment digit display.

## Notes:
- Multiple seven segment displays were added to the datapath in the simulation for debugging purposes, allowing the user to see the evolution of the information through the processor.
- The Memory contains additional circuitry for debugging purposes, its allows the hot modification of the RAM cells. This circuitry could make feel like the Memory bloc is more complex than it should be.
